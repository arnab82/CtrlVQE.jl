    Devices

*In silico* representation of quantum devices, in which quantum states evolve in time.

In this package,
    the "static" components (e.g., qubit frequencies, couplings, etc.)
    and the "drive" components (e.g., control signal, variational parameters, etc.)
    are *all* integrated into a single `DeviceType` object.
All you need to know how a quantum state `Ïˆ` evolves up time `T` is in the device.
